"""The Cowork agent — a workspace-bound knowledge-work coworker.

You spin up a Cowork session to solve an *isolated problem* and produce a **deliverable** (a
research memo, an analysis, a plan, a data pull, a small script). Like Code it has a workspace
+ files + shell, but it's outcome-oriented and general — not git-centric. Its tool factory is
shared with MyHelper (the always-on helper runs the same toolset under a different prompt).
